## About Me
I am a master's student at [the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley](https://www.utrgv.edu/), majoring in Electrical Engineering in [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.utrgv.edu/ece/). Before UTRGV, I worked as a research developer at ISCAS(BeiJing) and Baidu(BeiJing) for about three years, giving me industrial AI experience. My last school study was [at Beijing University of Technology](https://www.bjut.edu.cn/), where I obtained my first master's degree, majoring in Computer Technology. I am focusing on Communication-Efficiency, Privacy-Preservation, Byzantine-Robustness, and Fairness of Decentralized Federated Learning, following in [Dr.Ping Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/ping-xu-utrgv/home). For my long-term goal, I want to use AI to benefit humankind and every human being, especially those in need.

## Research Interests

- **FEDERATED LEARNING:** Privacy/Robustness/Fairness in Federated Learning.
- **COMPUTER VISION:** Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning, Contrastive Learning.

## News

- **[Apr. 2024]** Our abstract entitled 'Robust Decentralized Federated Learning Against both Distributional Shifts and Byzantine Attacks' has been accepted for a poster presentation at ICORS meets DSSV 2024.
- **[Feb. 2024]** I have been selected as CECS Outstanding Graduate Student of 2023 at UTRGV!  
- **[Sep. 2023]** I received a Presidential Research Fellowship of EECE at UTRGV and will start my research there in the Fall semester of 2023.
